# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview and Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier using a neural network that would predict whether organizational applicants will be successful or not when funded by this organization.  Based on metadata of more than 34,000 organizations that received prior funding from "Alphabet Soup", a neural network model was created then optimized for the dataset.  

Data were preprocessed and an initial model was compiled, trained, and evaluated.  Attempts to optimize the model were made to increase its performance above 75% accuracy.

## Resources
- Data Sources: charity_data.csv
- Software and Programming Languages: Jupyter Notebook v. 6.4.6; Python v. 3.8.3 :: Anaconda, Inc.; conda v. 4.11.0; scikit-learn v. 0.23.1:: Anaconda, Inc.; tensorflow v. 2.8.0:: Anaconda, Inc.; keras 2.8.0:: Anaconda, Inc.

## Results
### **Data Preprocessing**
 - What variable(s) were considered targets for the model?  The target variable was represented in the column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" and was a binary response.

 - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?  The final dataframe,
