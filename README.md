# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview and Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier using a neural network that would predict whether organizational applicants will be successful or not when funded by this organization.  Based on metadata of more than 34,000 organizations that received prior funding from "Alphabet Soup", a neural network model was created then optimized for the dataset.
